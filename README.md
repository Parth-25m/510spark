We have the best hands free solution to your presentation needs! Have you ever presented to an audience and not had the ability to interact and change your meeting controls on the go? Spark is a solution to use gestures to change your volume and screen sharing settings while you present. You no longer need to type a value, instead just give your camera a gesture and keep on presenting. We guarantee, it will be the most seemless, hands-free presentation you have had! 

## Capabilities 

- Allows two users to join a video conferencing web application
- Provides capabilities for user to be able to use gestures to manipulate the web conferencing interface.
    - Show a thumbs up __to change volume__ 
    - Swipe left or right to interact with your __screen sharing capabilities__.
