## Troubleshooting 

Having issues with something in Spark? Here is a list of commonly found problems and potential solutions: 

__Launching Screen Share__: When accessing the software, I am not able to screen share. 

Solutions: 
- Check to make sure there is another partcipant in the call. If only one user is connected, screen sharing functionality is not available. 
- When you do screen share, it is expected that your screen share view will replace your video view when sent to the other user. 

__Microphone/Camera Button Not Working__: The mic/camera button will not allow me to click it. 

Solutions: 
- Check to see if the settings for the browser you are in are allowing microphone/camera connections. Enable them and it should work. 
- Try refreshing the page or rejoining the room. 
- Still not working? Check the console logs to see if there is issues accessing the media devices.
